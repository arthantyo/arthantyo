### Hello world!

My name is Arthantyo, an aspiring software engineer based in the Netherlands. 

I am captivated by medium-to-large scale and high-impact software/hardware that shape the world we live in today. 

I create small passion projects to build my experience, notably [@Matcha](https://github.com/arthantyo/matcha), a VSCode extension for watching/reading anime and manga (100+ installs), [@Bobatimes](https://bobatimes.vercel.app/), a cozy boba clicker website (50+ users), and so on which aren't public yet.
