I code stuff. Mainly in C++, Typescript, and Python (maybe go).

Most of the "stuff" I build are graphic sim, web apps, data aggregators, gamedev, hardwares, iots and the list goes on.

I was also an ~~obsidian~~ enthusiast as well as a core believer of "linux-ricing". should i make osu beatmaps chat???
